<h1>LastFM Listening Activity Collage Maker</h1>
This Ruby on Rails is for creating collages based on LastFM Data! Uses vanilla JavaScript in the FrontEnd, and mySQL for database storage

You can insert your 

* LastFM Username
* The type of time frame of data you would like (7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, a year)
* The collage size (3x3, 4x4, 5x5)

Then a collage image is generated of your most listened to albums according to the metrics entered!
